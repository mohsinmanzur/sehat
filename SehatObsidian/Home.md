# Sehat — Vault Home

Sehat (aka "SehatScan") bridges patients and doctors through digitized medical reports and **consent-based, time-bound sharing** of health data. Built at FAST National University, Karachi.

> Patient scans a report → OCR/AI digitizes it → stored in Azure Blob Storage → doctor requests access → patient approves → time-bound access token issued → doctor views record → token auto-expires.

## Map of Content

### Architecture
- [[Overview]] — tech stack, repo layout, deployment
